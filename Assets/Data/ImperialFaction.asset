    factionDescription: "\xB7The great cities of Arden Eld are growing, stretching
      at their limits. Some have crowned kings, dictators, or patricians. Other set
      their ambitions higher - to create a nation, or recreate the old empire - a
      terrible endeavor indeed. The leaders of the Imperials are single-minded people
      in love with regalia, the war-banner, the factory, and the clang of steel.
      They worship the musket. Their soldiers on the ground are less enthusiastic,
      but given the chance, they will trample the Green into mud and ashes none the
      less. \xB7Imperials make heavy use of salvaged and repurposed arkentech, that
      drive the enginecores of their massive war machines and automatons. The black-powder
      weapons that they employ are low quality but effective in mass."

      templateDescription: Massive landships, Azurian weapons are steambelching monstrosities
        that use a combination of prow-mounted drill and tracked locomotion to plow
        through the earth, causing completely impractical amounts of destruction
        in their wake. They mount heavy arktentech artillery that can pound an entire
        town to dust in short order. Like  other Weapons, they are part automata,
        and can function without a crew - though they often have one and are used
        to transport imperial regiments long distances.

          traitDescription: "This Weapon fight takes place on the Weapon, an airship
            that could be any shape, but is better run on a smaller, rectangular
            map of no more than 10 or 12 spaces on its longest side. The deck of
            the airship is treated as basic terrain and not a character (it\u2019s
            too heavily armored), but its three sections can be attacked to deal
            damage to it."

          traitName: Arkentech Megabomb
          traitDescription: The Weapon has a massive Arkentech weapon that is constantly
            charging. If it is allowed to fire it, it ends the fight, resulting in
            a player loss. Usually the weapon firing will result in some massive
            loss of life, like a town being wiped out, but you can decide what the
            stakes are for your game.\n\nTrack the bomb's energy charge with a d6.
            It starts at 1, and ticks up by 1 at the start of each round past the
            first. If the Veridian Weapon ends a round with its charge at 6 or higher,
            the fight is over. Players can deplete the charge by destroying sections,
            and the weapon can increase it with certain abilities.

          traitDescription: "\u2022 Each section is a separate size 2 character that
            is immobile and has 1/3 of the Weapon\u2019s total HP. If removed from
            the battlefield, can only be placed in the same space. \n\u2022 Sections
            cannot be placed within range 2 of each other. \n\u2022 The Sections
            also count as height 2 <i>objects.</i> Other characters can move on them
            or use them as cover \n\u2022 When acting, the Weapon acts with only
            one of its sections at a time. It must take a turn with each of its sections
            in a round before taking a turn with a different section. \n\u2022 When
            a section is reduced to 0 hp, it is destroyed and removed from the battlefield.
            \n\u2022 When all three are destroyed, the Weapon is defeated."

        with multiple barrels, scopes, or other unnecessary additions), gunners are
        the hammers to the anvil of the legion frontlines. Flashy, armed with the
        teeth, and with an attitude to match, they are the envy of the infantry.
        They make use of steam automata from repurposed arkentech to drive their
        opponents into poor positions.
