  Traits:
  - traitName: Kin
    traitEffect: "Hobs can (technically) be bargained with, and will occasionally
      flee or surrender when they are badly losing a fight. Unless greatly pressed,
      hobs that are considered kin will never kill characters intentionally, preferring
      to punish or humiliate. \n<b>\u2022 Motivations: </b>Hobs are usually strongly
      motivated by trespass or injury against the land. Some are motivated by some
      perceived slight or offense against some ancient bargain, rule, or compact.
      Still others are simply motivated by natural beauty or whimsy and don\u2019t
      see malice in their own actions. \n<b>\n\u2022 Flee: </b>Being immortal nature
      spirits, being killed doesn\u2019t really bother a Hob (they will usually return
      with the next season), but they can be flighty and will run away if afraid"
