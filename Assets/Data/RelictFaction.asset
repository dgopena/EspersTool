    factionDescription: "\xB7Relict are the most common danger that adventurers face
      in the ruins of Arden Eld. They are the spectral remnants of the Arken Empire,
      souls bound in an etheric network that runs through the ruins, entrapped there
      by an ancient sorcerer as a last ditch effort to save a dying people. The process
      was technically successful, but most relict have been left mindless husks -
      souls harnessed and stored in lightning powered sarcophagus-like nodes nestled
      throughout the ruins. Relict armor sits eerily still, or crumpled into a corner,
      until its a node senses intruders, the Relict within rippling out through conduits
      to manifest in crackling undeath. \xB7There are some Relict - a priest class
      - that have retained more sense of themselves and work at dark purpose to resurrect
      the old empire and bring back the arkenlords."

        diplomacy - at the tip of a sword if need be. There were forty of these knights,
        ten for each of the cardinal directions. Each was a hero of unparalleled
        strength, their name recorded in the annals of the imperial muster, and blessed
        by the Emperor. \xB7While they still lived, these knights were marked by
        dark ritual, their very essences bound to their armor so that they could
        continue their duty even in death or after mortal injury. During the Doom,
        they all succumbed, but this did not stop them from carrying out their orders.
        Repeated death has stripped most of them of their sense. Now they are vaporous
        husks - hollow iron shells filled with dust and a sense of loathsome purpose.
        When the ruins rise, they rise from their graves and call forth armies, slaughtering
        and conquering in the name of an empire that no longer exists until they
        are beaten and sealed again."

        of the Empire, these minor Arkenlords were entombed with their troops, buried
        alive under rubble, scoured by dread magics and left smoking on the battlefields,
        or burned alive in the smoking cities of the Arken. Their immortalization
        crystallized their hatred at their failure to protect the empire, honing
        it to a razor's edge. Now, in death, they lie dreaming, entangled in nightmares
        of ceaseless bloodlust and brutal conquest. The priests of the Black Sun
        work endlessly at their resurrection, for when the Dread Lords can be awakened,
        their wrath is terrible, and their ambition endless.
