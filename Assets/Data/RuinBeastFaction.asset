    factionDescription: "\xB7The ruins are full of wildlife that has adapted to their
      unique environment over time - or have been changed or warped by it. Wherever
      there are dungeons or a Blight, there are Beasts. They are the most common
      monsters found afield in the blight-stricken areas of Arden Eld, and the most
      likely to wander adrift. \xB7Beasts fit into a dungeon ecosystem much the same
      as they do in more mundane ecosystems outside of their unnatural environments.
      There are many biologists and naturalists across Arden Eld undertaking the
      hard work of categorizing the dizzying number of species that are found every
      week by intrepid adventurers. Many beast organs and excretions are extremely
      useful in medicine, research, industry, and even cosmetics, and teams of hunters
      are often sent out to bag a particularly beast once its kind are sighted. \xB7Some
      naturalists are more in favor of conservation, and argue that despite their
      strange origins, the beasts of the great dungeons, though dangerous and unusual,
      should be treated as just another part of the natural world. They\u2019re more
      interested in studying the beasts and preventing them from harming local communities
      than actively poaching them. \xB7Not all ruin beasts are hostile, and some
      are in fact quite docile unless provoked. However, nearly all of them are capable
      of tremendous bursts of strength and power when enraged, a by product of their
      harsh environment - and necessary for survival."

        the blight lands, the Apexes are incredible dangerous, aggressive beasts
        that are the primal lords of their kind. These beasts are naturally occurring
        in some blight land species, but also occur when a particular beast gains
        unnatural power and strength from exposure to blighted food or soil. Apexes
        are incredibly durable, aggressive, and intelligent for beasts of their type,
        and display a range of incredible natural abilities, from shooting lightning
        from specially shaped scales, to venomous fangs, to clouds of steam generated
        from special glands. Thrill seekers, researchers, profiteers, and foolhardy
        adventurers alike pursue these beasts and seek to hunt or capture them for
        not only their rare and bizarre physiology, but also in hopes of curing them,
        studying them, or preventing them from preying on the hapless or unwary.

      templateDescription: When the world was young and still scalding and steaming
        from the raw energies of its creation, the Wyrms were born. Massive, serpentine
        beasts, they emerged from the molten earth fully formed, or so the legend
        goes. These ancient beast gods ruled the land for a time, and then their
        age passed, as all ages will, and the world changed. The wyrms went into
        hibernation, curling up and sinking into the earth, resting in unceasing
        slumber. As they slept, they conserved their energy, for another age, when
        they could emerge and feed, growing fat and strong again. \n\nWyrms have
        a primal aetherstone instead of their heart. This allows them to channel
        unbelievable raw energies that were present when the world was young, and
        spit scouring divine fire that turns nearly all matter to ash. \n\nOccasionally,
        over the history of Arden Eld, a wyrm will naturally awake from its long
        sleep. The emergence of a wyrm is a cataclysmic event similar to a volcanic
        eruption or a natural disaster. The land quakes and belches forth poison
        gas and magma, plants wither, and wildlife flees from the eruption site.
        It quickly establishes a hunting grounds and rules over a massive territory
        as a primeval monarch, culling herds of animals (including kin) to acceptable
        populations to maintain its feeding stock. \n\nMore recently, the Churn has
        awakened more and more Wyrms, an unfolding calamity with no easy solution
        and terrifying consequences.

      templateDescription: An enormous ruin beast resembling a cross between a hippopotamus
        and a massive, corpulent ape. It spends most of its day sleeping, and the
        rest eating. Though usually content to feed on trees and local dungeon flora,
        it is an incredibly strong hunter capable of insane bursts of speed and aggression,
        as creatures that disturb its rest are capable of finding out. Many adventurers
        have been shocked at the sight of one of these rotund giants tearing a demon
        in half.
