    factionDescription: "\xB7A society of rejects, survivors, and outcasts, lowlanders
      are a relatively new development in Arden Eld - those that make their homes
      in the maze of dungeons under the blightlands - the areas around long-emerged
      and active arkenruins that are inhospitable to life and full of monsters, where
      the very ground might be poison. They often live in squalor and constant danger
      from their harsh environment, and band together for survival into loose clans.
      \xB7Those that live in the blightlands are often pariahs, exiled from society,
      for real or perceived transgressions. Families and children are practically
      nonexistent, and there\u2019s usually tragedy behind their stoic facades. \xB7Lowlanders
      are nearly all raiders, using the blight as a natural barrier, attacking the
      towns, farms, and lands outside when they need to gather supplies and retreating
      into the blight when pursued. Some principled lowlander clans may try to avoid
      bloodshed and take only what they need, but the villages they take from would
      nearly all see it differently. \xB7Clanners make use of the giant (and very
      dangerous) insect species of the Blightlands for labor, transportation, food,
      and protection. Many of them have also developed a semireligious respect for
      the dungeons that in its worse forms can manifest as cult-like reverence."
