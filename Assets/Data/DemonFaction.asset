    factionDescription: "\xB7The origin of Demons is a mystery, but most scholars
      agree they appear to be closely related to the Doom. They are among the most
      dangerous and fearsome creatures that lurk in the deep levels of the Arkenruins,
      existing seemingly only to destroy. Whenever they appear, they drive other
      creatures to the surface in a Blight. \xB7The deeper you go in the ruins, the
      more demons you come across, and the more reality seems to fall apart. Some
      of the more infamous and unconquered ruins in Arden Eld descend miles and miles,
      deep into the earth, where they eventually dissolve into lightless Abyss, full
      of squirming Natal demons that crawl over each other like maggots, and stalked
      by enormous, misshapen horrors."

      templateDescription: A massive, worm-like demon that appears to be made up
        of fused rings of hands and arms. Theories about as to how a monstrosity
        like this gets it start, but a common postulation is that when the population
        of natals becomes too high in deep areas of the Abyss, they run out of room
        and fuse into these larger demons, which devour and absorb their nest-mates
        until the new amalgamate being becomes strong enough to eat its way to the
        surface. Unlucky prey of the Limb demon are often stuffed into its maw still
        alive, where they are fused and absorbed over time. Some are rescuable -
        for a time.

      templateDescription: Type VI demons, which seem to feed off strong negative
        emotions in the way other demons feed off flesh. Prominent demonologists
        have theorized demons are themselves shaped by the fears and concepts of
        kin, as their true forms exist on a plane of reality utterly incomprehensible
        to normal senses. It would certainly explain the way terror demons seem to
        be able to warp themselves into imitations of primal fears.
