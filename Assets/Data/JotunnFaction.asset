    factionDescription: "\xB7Distant cousins of the Troggs, Jotunn were born of the
      Titans and served them when the world was young. A variety of peoples, they
      are united only by their extreme age, prodigious strength, and enormous stature.
      Most Jotunn stand twice the height of other kin, some as big as a small building.
      \xB7Jotunn seem virtually immune to disease, and do not age, making them technically
      immortal, though they can still be slain by a powerful enough foe. They do
      not reproduce, but were made by the titans, fully formed. There are therefore
      a limited number of them in the world (though many have yet to emerge), and
      eventually their age will pass. This is something many Jotunn are keenly aware
      of. \xB7Jotunn have long but very fallible memories, and the ancients remember
      the Arken and the Doom, and have witnessed the sins of Kin throughout the age.
      This tends to make them melancholy, distrustful, or resentful. At their best,
      they are burdened by the weights of their long lives. Many ancient Jotunn wander
      the land or stand guard over crumbling titan ruins, following the edicts, patrol
      routes, and tasks given to them by their ancient lords, so long ago that even
      they have forgotten. Others seek out the cities and towns of Kin, finding purpose
      in labor, learning, or battle. \xB7The slaying of the titans scattered their
      blood across the land, where it sunk smoking into the earth. Where the blood
      crystallized and pooled, it formed cysts that grew a new crop of Jotunn. The
      Jotunn that have emerged from the earth in the millennia since then have all
      emerged insane, and driven only by the pain and rage of their dying progenitors,
      going on rampages until they are slain or collapse dead from exhaustion. \xB7Older
      Jotunn often seek out their insane kin in order to put them down or out of
      some faint hope for salvation, hoping for some final end to their pain."

        These demigods rode primal titan steeds born of the wind and storm, six-legged
        monstrous horses that could ride on their air as easily as the earth. They
        were bridled with gold and hitched to the Hall, as it was the Riders\u2019

        and its fragments scattered across the land. The Riders are less than a dozen
        in number but still ride the great storms that gather over the deep oceans
        of Arden Eld. When such a storm sweeps over the land, the joyous war cries
        of a Rider and the thunder of unearthly hooves can sometimes be felt in the
        bones of the mortals that cower in their flimsy shelters below. \u2022Riders
        are legendary, boisterous warriors that only descend to the earth for tasks
        of great import or to stave off their ancient melancholy with the thrill
        of battle, largely leaving the earthly realm alone. Stories abound of foolish
        and hubristic mortal heroes challenging the storm, only for the storm to
        answer. They are scions of destruction and the lightning is at their beck

      templateDescription: "\u2022The rarest and most powerful Tethians in Arden
        Eld, beings imbued with a tiny fragment of true divine power, who guard the
        many-pillared gates at the high and low places of the earth. What lies beyond
        the gates is a matter of deep theosophical speculation. Some believe them
        to be a portal to great treasures. Still others believe beyond them lies
        the Garden of Eyoning, the place where the fruit of immortality was cultivated.
        Other, more pessimistic observers believe it to be a plane of deepest abyss,
        and the gate wardens are not guarding the gates from the outside, but defending
        the outside world from the gates. \u2022The church of the Chanters believe
        beyond the gates is the Highest House, the seat of the Creators that sat
        even above the Titans, and the final (and thankfully unrealized) conquest
        goal of the Arken Imperium. Whether the House is empty or occupied is unknown
        and a frequent topic of dogma. \u2022The point is moot anyway, as nobody,
        not even the Imperium, was able to fight its way past a gate warden."

      templateDescription: Lesser storm jotunn, descendants of the eternal halls.
        Strong enough to rip an ox in half with their bare hands, as big around as
        a carriage and twice as heavy. These jotunn are hairy, tusked, and often
        horned, like their lesser kin, the troggs. Their shaggy pelts and thick hides
        turn away spear strikes and sword blows from would-be hunters. In battle,
        they steam with heat and are capable of inciting the Berserkgang, a tremendous
        blood rage, even in their opponents. Largely spurning civilization, these
        jotunn are tremendous eaters, extremely crafty, and spend their days hunting,
        rune-carving, and smithing at their cavernous forges carved from bare rock.
        Their bestial disposition belies a canny intellect and they are fond of riddles,
        stories, and drinking games.

        teeth - hands, arms, or legs that are still able to act for a few minutes
        after being lopped off.

        ruins. They make their homes in colossal broken towers, fallen bridges, or
        longshattered city gates. All Tethians are keepers and guardians of dangerous
        or forbidden knowledge. Sometimes their ward is a physical location such
        as a gate or door, or a sealed vault. Other times, the Tethian themselves
        holds the knowledge or power in their minds or bodies, acting as a living
        prison. Though they are not skilled in wrightcraft in the traditional sense,
        they can easily manipulate aether through their bodies and are masters of
        rune-cunning. Most, if not all Tethians, have either a third eye on their
        body or skull, or only a single eye in the middle of their head. This unique
        eye can only see Aether, and is capable of focusing it into intensely powerful
        beams the same way a prism focuses light.
