          (1 - none, 2- N, 3-E, 4-S, 5-W, 6- GM choice). The Jotunn falls into a
          medium blast area placed adjacent to its space in that direction. Size
          1 characters inside must save or take 6 damage, or 3 on a successful save.
          Move all characters out of the area into the closest available space and
          place the defeated Jotunn there. They count as a 2x2 height 1 <i>object</i>

          flee or surrender when they are badly losing a fight. Unless greatly pressed,
          hobs that are considered kin will never kill characters intentionally,
          preferring to punish or humiliate. \n<b>\u2022 Motivations: </b>Hobs are
          usually strongly motivated by trespass or injury against the land. Some
          are motivated by some perceived slight or offense against some ancient
          bargain, rule, or compact. Still others are simply motivated by natural
          beauty or whimsy and don\u2019t see malice in their own actions. \n<b>\n\u2022
          Flee: </b>Being immortal nature spirits, being killed doesn\u2019t really
          bother a Hob (they will usually return with the next season), but they
          can be flighty and will run away if afraid"
