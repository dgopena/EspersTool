    description: Lord of the Center, the Black Iron Lord. Arken nobles granted this
      title were renowned and greatly feared generals tasked with controlling and
      holding the center mass of a combat, and in other times protecting the homelands
      of the Empire and keeping order by rooting out seditionists and rebels. In
      life, they crushed all before them with cold-hearted brutality. In death, there
      is little difference.
