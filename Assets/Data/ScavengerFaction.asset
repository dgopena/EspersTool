    factionDescription: "\xB7Scavengers is a particular term in Arden Eld, referring
      to the scions of the Churning Age - those who rush into the ruins in search
      of relics to extract for a quick profit, or prowl the roads in search of vulnerable
      folk to shake down. Many find that it is easier to have others do the hard
      work for them, then rob them blind on the way out. \xB7Scavenger bands are
      as diverse as any other folk of Arden Eld, but usually turn to scavenging out
      of a desire for profit, something that can be intensely personal. Many scavengers
      come from the cities, seeking wealth from the ruins that was denied to them
      by virtue of social class in their homelands. Still others are opportunists,
      deserters from Imperial armies, Churners whose business has dried up, or people
      from local villages that were sick of the parochial life and wanted to exercise
      their ambition. A lot of the time, they are barely one step away from adventurers.
      \xB7Not all scavenger bands employ banditry, and some are actually large, \u2018legitimate\u2019
      enterprises, sanctioned by the major guilds (frequently involving a lot of
      corruption). These bands are run by individuals colloquially known as Churn
      Barons - ruthless profiteers who will turn to any means to make money"

      templateDescription: "\u2022Good things come in pairs, or so they say. \u2022Splitting
        the loot can be a tenuous and tedious process, and often involves a lot of
        backstabbing. Some exceptionally well resourced mercenaries have found it
        very useful, and even preferable, to use blood magic to solve this common
        problem. By entangling their soul aether in a powerful ritual, they become
        unable to die as long as the other one lives. That way, there\u2019s no way
        for them to cut and run - or for anyone else to pull a fast one without taking
        their soul bound partner down at nearly exactly the same time - a difficult
        prospect. \u2022People that are \u2018twinned\u2019 this way tend to grow
        very close to their twin, and even come to resemble them in their mannerism
        and sometimes physical appearance, a side effect of the wrightcraft used
        to bond them together. \u2022Twinblades are often found guarding the leaders
        of scavenger bands, acting as enforcers, and collecting the lion\u2019s share

          traitDescription: "At the start of their turn, the Ring Finger puts down
            a track in their space. A character that enters that space collects the
            track. When a track has been collected, the Ring Finger\u2019s Master
            Cloak trait deactivates until the end of the Finger\u2019s next turn."

          traitDescription: "While this trait is active, the Ring Finger is unstoppable,
            has <i>phasing,</i> and cannot be directly targeted at all. Their location
            is not revealed on the map. Instead, the GM secretly records their location.
            Auras, area <i>effects,</i> and other effects that can target a space
            affect them normally (taking into account dodge). This trait deactivates
            until the end of the Finger\u2019s next turn if a track is collected
            or the Finger attacks.\r"
