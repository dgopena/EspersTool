    factionDescription: "\xB7Though many regard chroniclers as sheltered, erudite,
      and austere, the stereotypes don\u2019t tend to fit a culture that values a
      deep drive for curiosity and learning. A close connection to the divine and
      a cultural sense of discipline and purpose tend to drive them forward. \xB7Monks,
      priests, and warrior-nuns of the chroniclers often descend from their mountain
      monasteries on quests of great import, often a task given to them by their
      elders interpreting a passage from the Great Chant, the Tale of Ages, the Yamangeriad,
      or some other holy text. This quite often brings them into conflict with folk
      who have no idea of their quest, especially when the instructions are based
      on centuries old prophecy. \xB7Occasionally more senior chroniclers are sent
      to retrieve or locate dangerous or powerful artifacts that were stolen or lost
      from the Chambers - no matter their current state, or their current owner."

      would be starved of supplies, medicine, and food. Their arrival in a town is
      part circus, part festival, and part market day. \xB7The caravans occasionally
      accept shady business, sometimes out of profit, sometimes out of desperation
      - transporting dangerous, rare, or illicit goods. Rarely, and usually due to
      some traumatic event, a wagon abandons the ways and strictures of the Multicolored
      Titan, and turns to banditry and thievery. These rogue wagons abandon the caravan
      and become similar to pirates - though they sail the seas of grass and stone

    factionDescription: "\xB7In the villages, you work together, you eat together,
      and you celebrate together. The earth supports you, and you support the earth.
      Life in the villages can be slow and appear sleepy or idyllic from the outside,
      but all villages must work hard to keep everyone safe, fed, and flourishing.
      Villages move with the seasons, the air, the forests, and the whims of the
      spirits. \xB7It\u2019s considered rare for Yeokin to stray too far from their
      villages (those that do tend to become adventurers), especially to cause trouble,
      but it does occasionally happen. Town priests and elders of larger towns sometimes
      start to ponder demanding tribute from their smaller neighbors, or sending
      over their largest and toughest to \u2018negotiate\u2019 favorable trade deals.
      When pushed into desperation by surging dungeons or untamed blights, Yeokin
      towns are occasionally abandoned, those remaining turning to any means necessary
      to survive."
