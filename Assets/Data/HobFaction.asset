    factionDescription: "\xB7Nature spirits of the Green and the Deep Green, Hobs
      are the keepers of field and forest. Tied intimately to the seasons, the flora
      and fauna of Arden Eld, and to the land itself, these ancient beings range
      from the tiny, mischievous spriggs to the the colossal Forest Gods. \xB7Hobs
      are animate spirits made of the aether of Arden Eld itself - the world soul,
      that inhabits every tiny rock, tree, and blade of grass. Most of the time these
      spirits slumber peacefully inside the land, their presence felt rather than
      seen, but in places where the aether of the world is especially strong, these
      spirits burgeon forth, emerging at the twilight hours to frolic, gallop, and
      clamber through the trees and streams. \xB7Hobs range from childlike or barely
      intelligent, to ancient and wise, depending on the aspect of nature they are
      tied to. The tiny spriggs are curious enough to follow travelers and smart
      enough to play tricks, but otherwise have no more awareness than the birds,
      mice, and flowers from which they draw their essence. Conversely, the Aesi
      are powerful and skilled in old, powerful magic, being tied to deep and dark
      lakes, enormous trees, rock formations, or embodied as ancient beasts or in
      the shape of kin. \xB7Most of the time, Hobs pay travelers little heed other
      than innocent curiosity, and many villages of the Green worship them along
      with a broad cast of local spirits, leaving offerings and prayers to placate
      them. The relationship is often harmonious and mutual - with Hobs often reciprocating
      by guiding travelers back to civilization, blessing harvests, or gifting small
      and valuable presents to local children. \xB7However, Hobs have existed far
      longer on Arden Eld than civilization and do not play by its rules. Some hobs
      have no more intelligence than the wild beasts from which they draw their essence,
      and can be just as dangerous. Others may find it perfectly acceptable to lead
      a traveler astray for three days in order to show them a breathtaking lake
      view, to encourage beautiful and colorful weeds to grow over a field, or to
      transform someone into a deer for a week so they can run wild in the forest.
      Occasionally, this turns sour and conflicts spring up between Kin and Hob -
      conflicts that Hobs remember for a very long time. A village priest familiar
      with their ways may grow old and die, or grandson may forget the yearly offering
      that his grandfather made to the local spirits, and the Hobs see no difference
      - only a sudden and unforgivable slight. \xB7In the worst cases, the aether
      of the land is stirred when the natural order is wounded. The Churn has driven
      more and more kin into the deeper parts of the land, as power-hungry kingdoms,
      barons, and princes use fire, axe, and machine to tear up the forests and mountains
      to fuel their industries and armies. In these cases, the Hobs that emerge from
      the wounded landscape are wild, vicious, or mad with rage. Driving up local
      animals into a frenzy, they become a terrifying force of nature that can wage
      all-out war with local towns or outposts, killing scores."

          hobs that are considered kin will never kill characters intentionally,
          preferring to punish or humiliate. \n<b>\u2022 Motivations: </b>Hobs are
          usually strongly motivated by trespass or injury against the land. Some
          are motivated by some perceived slight or offense against some ancient
          bargain, rule, or compact. Still others are simply motivated by natural
          beauty or whimsy and don\u2019t see malice in their own actions. \n<b>\n\u2022

          bother a Hob (they will usually return with the next season), but they

        midsummer festivals and the raucous partying that usually accompanies them.
        These horned goat-like Aesi can often speak the tongue of kin. During summer
        festivals in the green, it is not uncommon for a midsummer Aesi to ramble
        in from the forest to join in and patronize the festivities, brining hob-spirit
        with them, the divine alcohol Ambrosia. Such spirits are treated with great
        respect and must be fed and watered well before their journey back into the
        forest. \xB7Good treatment of these minor forest gods brings good harvests
        and wealth to the village, however, courting them is not without risk. These
        Aesi, though they have a jovial temperament, are wild and unrestrained in
        their passions, as the beasts they draw their essence from. They have tremendous
        appetites, and in the throes of drink they go into a rage and rile up partygoers
        into great (and often dangerous) acts of debauchery and stupor. Without care,
        villages often end up half on fire, sodden with alcohol, and strewn with
        unconscious partygoers. A common strategy is to spike the Aesi\u2019s drink,
        so they calmly fall asleep and disappear with the morning mist."

        powerful and ancient. These hobs are shaped more like Kin than their more
        animalistic brethren and are extremely skilled in the ways of sword craft
        and stealth. They are master thieves and can steal anything: a moment, an
        essence, a thought, or even a memory. Though they eventually return what
        they stole, they are indiscriminate in their fascination with the habits
        and skills of Kin. Legends abound of them stealing the skills of master tradesman
        on a whim for a fortnight, leading to their poor victim\u2019s financial
        ruin, or stealing the tongue of a bride for a year and a day, leading her

      overallTemplateName: 
      templateDescription: The Aesi of Deep Winter. Each takes seventy seasons to
        coalesce. During that time, their essence slowly condenses, taking in the
        sorrow of frozen death, the withering of plant life, and the landscapes of
        barren snow. Unlike their kin, they are somber, solitary, and melancholy
        beings with an air of gravitas about them. They can only be glimpsed during
        the deep cold, or in the dead of night. Their benediction can allow villages
        to survive the winter - with unexplained warm spells, mysterious hidden caches
        of crops, or respite from storms and blizzards. When enraged, however, their
        wrath is terrible, and they will freeze entire towns solid just to avenge
        the most minor slight.

      templateDescription: Hobs that coalesce in and around the dwellings and towns
        of Kin. Tend to be able to speak a little of the tongue of Kin, and have
        a fondness for trinkets and other shiny items. Can often only be seen by
        children. When treated well, act as family guardians and protectors of the
        hearth. When treated poorly, can become akin to poltergeists or spirits of
        ill mischief.

        feet, able to soar through the air with just a touch. They tend to be rotund
        and relatively relaxed, so are often underestimated by unlucky travelers.
        Surprisingly intelligent despite their lack of speech and bestial form, they
        are extremely protective of children of all kinds, and have a habit of unintentionally
        abducting them for long stretches of time. They often become confused, and
        due to their large size, see most Kin as lost children, which can lead to
        some unfortunate incidents.

        stags, but also boars, wolves, or other creatures of the wild. These ancient
        hobs are older than all civilizations and have existed since the days of
        creation. Herds of animals follow in their wake. They are largely peaceful,
        and flighty - unless hunted, as their blood is said to cure all ailments.
        Then, they can drive animals into a frenzy and become hostile to all kin
        for many years. As the forests of Arden Eld wither and shrink, these beautiful
        and majestic hobs are increasingly rare, or sometimes turn up ill and sickly.
